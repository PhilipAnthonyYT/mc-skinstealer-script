# Minecraft Account Skin Stealer
In this repository are two scripts. A **.bat** and a **.sh** file.
The **.bat** script if for Windows users. The **.sh** script is for MacOS and Linux users.
Simply run the script on your computer. It will ask you to enter a username. Enter the username of the account you wish to download the skin of, and the script will download a **(USERNAME)_skin.png** file, where (USERNAME) is the username you entered.
For example, entering the username **DanTDM** into the script, the script will download the skin of the YouTuber DanTDM in the same folder as the script under the name **DanTDM_skin.png**.
On Linux, you may need to allow the script to be run as a program, which isn't enabled be default on most distros.
